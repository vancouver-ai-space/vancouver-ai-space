# Week 1's Game Plan :dart:

We’re off to an amazing start. It’s cool to see all of you diving in with energy and creativity. I am confident every one of you can build something awesome and impactful.

### This Week's Focus: **Create your AI Idea Slide**.
- Use this 2-slide template for your idea idea: [Google Slides Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EZI1ySWCyCMXCi3KaqdMxs5I3ftKpQtLtuGKdctFhhs/edit?usp=sharing)

- See below for daily steps you can take this week. 
   - If some steps seem counterintuitive that's okay - please trust the process.
   - These are some of the best practices I acquired over the 10 years of experience working in research labs and industries.

Everything you do earns points toward your Certificate of Completion (and bragging rights :trophy:).  
- You need **70 points to pass** (out of 100).  
- **Bonus points** are for recommended but optional items!

## :star2: Tuesday (15 mins)
1. **Post on LinkedIn or Twitter (+5 bonus points):**  
   Let the world know you’re working on something exciting! Then share the link to your tweet on #general channel
   
**Example on Twitter:**   
> “Excited to start my journey with @VanAISpace to work on my AI idea over the next six weeks! #AI #Innovation”

2. **Announce Your Intention & Accomplishments (+5 points):**  
   Post in the #accountability channel.  
   **Example:**  
 > “My intention this week is to come up with an AI idea that solves a real problem and blows people’s minds. :star2:”

 > “I have finished today's steps! :star2:”

3. **Brainstorm Ideas (+20 points):**  
   Share 2–3 rough ideas in the #project-ideas channel that we can give feedback to. 
   If you would like to have collaborators just add the tag **(open for collaboration)**

   **Example:**  
   - Idea 1: An AI tool that helps students stay focused by playing concentration-boosting music.  
   - Idea 2: An AI-powered plant care assistant that tells you when your plants need water or sunlight.  
   - Idea 3: A personalized AI tutor for kids learning math in fun, interactive ways.
